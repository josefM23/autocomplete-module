# Automated Tests Summary

In this project, I implemented automated tests using Jest to ensure the functionality of the **AutocompleteModule** and the overall behavior of the application. Below is a summary of the tests that were created:

## 1. Test: AutocompleteModule Data Uniqueness
**Purpose:**  
To ensure that the `setData()` function correctly processes the input data and removes duplicate values.

**What is Tested:**  
- Verifies that the input data provided to `setData()` is cleaned and any duplicate entries are filtered out.
- Ensures only unique values are stored in the `data` array in lowercase.

**Expected Result:**  
- The internal `data` array should contain only unique values after calling `setData()`.  
- Example: When `['Apple', 'Banana', 'Apple']` is provided, the result should be `['apple', 'banana']`.

**Test Result:**  
- ✅ Passed
---

## 2. Test: Input Handling and Search Trigger
**Purpose:**  
To check that user input triggers the correct behavior for the autocomplete component.

**What is Tested:**  
- Input values should trigger the filtering of suggestions when the input length is greater than or equal to 3 characters.
- The search functionality should filter and display matching suggestions based on the input.

**Expected Result:**  
- When typing at least 3 characters, suggestions that match the input are displayed.
- If no matches are found, a message saying "No matches found" should appear.

**Test Result:**  
- ✅ Passed
---

## 3. Test: Suggestions Rendering
**Purpose:**  
To verify that the suggestions list is properly rendered with matching suggestions.

**What is Tested:**  
- The suggestions list (`ul`) should display when valid matches are found during search.
- When a user clicks on a suggestion, it should populate the input field.

**Expected Result:**  
- The `li` elements should be created for each matching suggestion.
- Clicking on a suggestion should populate the input field with that suggestion.

**Test Result:**  
- ✅ Passed
---

## 4. Test: Clear Suggestions Functionality
**Purpose:**  
To verify that the suggestions list is cleared properly when the input is empty or invalid.

**What is Tested:**  
- The suggestions list is cleared when input conditions are not met (e.g., fewer than 3 characters or invalid characters).

**Expected Result:**  
- The `clearSuggestions()` function should empty the suggestions list (`ul#suggestions`).

**Test Result:**  
- ✅ Passed
---

## Summary
These automated tests ensure that the key functionalities of the **AutocompleteModule** — including data handling, input handling, suggestions rendering, and UI updates — work as expected. Each test verifies specific aspects of the module’s behavior, ensuring both correctness and reliability. All tests have successfully passed.
