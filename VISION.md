# Vision Document for MusicMatch

## Background and Problem Description

**MusicMatch** is a personal prototype project aimed at testing the integration and functionality of the **autocomplete module** in a dynamic environment. The ultimate goal of this project is to test how the autocomplete module interacts with music data retrieval, specifically in relation to databases (where the search is performed) and dictionaries (what specific items are being searched).

The **MusicMatch** application is fully functional, but it does not target any specific end-users or customer base. Its main objective is internal testing, and while it may lead to future developments, there is no current focus on real-world use. We will see how the results of this testing can be used for other purposes.

## Users/Target Audience

The primary audience for **MusicMatch** is myself and developers who are interested in testing and refining autocomplete functionality within a music search environment. This project focuses on technical validation rather than delivering a product for end-users. But..?

## Market

This project does not aim to compete in the commercial market, but instead focuses on technical validation. However, the future use of the **autocomplete module** will add value to the e-commerce platform by enhancing user experience during product search. The ability to integrate autocomplete functionality with real-time data from APIs like **Last.fm** will ensure a dynamic and responsive user interaction.

## Basic Requirements/Features/Unique Selling Points

- **Fully Functional Prototype**: The application will be fully functional in terms of retrieving and displaying search results using an autocomplete interface.
- **Dynamic Music Data**: Integration with **Last.fm API** will allow for real-time music data retrieval (songs, artists, albums) to test how the autocomplete module performs with dynamic data.
- **Flexible Design for Future Integration**: Though this project is a standalone test, the module is designed to be flexible for integration into a larger e-commerce platform in the future.
- **Modifiable UI Components**: UI elements such as the search input field and results list are designed to be modifiable for future adjustments, especially in the `HomeView.js` and `SearchView.js` files.
- **No Fixed User Base**: As a test project, it does not aim to serve end-users or customers but will be fully operational.
- **Integration and Adaptation of the Autocomplete Module**: Significant changes to the autocomplete module will be necessary to ensure it works seamlessly within MusicMatch. In this version, the module will be fully integrated into the application and will not function independently without MusicMatch.

## Future E-Shop Integration

In the future, the **autocomplete module** developed in **MusicMatch** will be part of an e-commerce platform, enhancing user experience by providing real-time product suggestions as users type. The integration will involve:

## Current Status

- **MusicMatch** is currently a test project focused on validating the functionality of the autocomplete module with dynamic music data using the **Last.fm API**.
- The application will be fully functional, but further adaptations are needed to tailor the autocomplete to specific music search use cases.
- Future development will involve refining the **UI components** (`HomeView.js`, `SearchView.js`) to fit the context of music data searching.
